# Weather-Application-
Module Project (WeatherApplication)
General Info
This project will be a Weather Application with a graphical User interface.When the
program starts, it should ask to select the country (Netherlands, Turkey or USA).
According to the selected country, the provinces should be listed based on the
population. User will be able to see the name of the province they chose, the state
they are in, the population, weather (as an icon), temperature. With the City search
option in the program, it should be able to show the city information and weather
conditions.
Tools:
• Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Graphical User Interface
(GUI) will be used in the project.
• PyQT5 will be used as GUI
• Scrapy will be used as Web Scrapping Tool.
• HTTP-Request and API will be used.
• PostgreSQL will be used as DBMS.
• Each team will have 1 mentor.
• GitHub will be used in the project.
• There will be a 30 minutes meeting with teammates every day.
• The content of the daily meeting is generally as follows:
1. 1.
What each person did
2. 2.
The general direction in the project
3. 3.
Task sharing until tomorrow
4. 4.

Steps
Suggestion:
-Step 1 can be done together in the group.
-Step 2, 3, and 4 can be done in parallel. Group members can share tasks.
Step 1:
• Design GUI for Weather App
o Consider Web Scrapping Data Visualisation
o Consider Web API Data Visualisation
• UML Design (Making Plan)
o You can use this tool to draw → https://app.diagrams.net/
o Use Case Diagram
o Class Diagram
• Design ERD for the current version of the Program. Add DB for
the current version of the Program according to the ERD design.
All information should be ordered and stored in DB No more file
usage.
Step 2:
• Scrapy will be used extracting the data you need from Wikipedia
web site.
https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lijst_van_Nederlandse_plaatsen_met_stadsrechten
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population
https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye%27deki_illerin_n%C3%BCfuslar%C4%B1_
(2020)
City, state and population information is drawn from the website addresses with
Scrapy.
The name of the selected City will be displayed in the program.
The region or state of the selected City will be shown in the program.
The population of the selected City will be displayed in the program.
All information should be ordered and stored in DB
Step 3:
•
o HTTP-Request and API will be used to pull real-time
weather information from the website.
o Weather information of the selected cities is taken from
https://openweathermap.org/api site.(You can choose other
web sites)
o The Temperature of the selected City will be displayed in
the Program.
o The Weather of the selected City will be displayed in the
program with Icons.
§ The icons and how to use the icons are explained in
detail on the site given below,
https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions .
All information should be ordered and stored in DB
Step 4:
Program Main page will contain the following components.
• Countries
• Selected Country, Cities, Regions, Populations ordered By
Population
• City Search Bar
• Selected City Name,
• Selected City Region,
• Selected City Population
• Selected City Temperature (Celsius)
• Selected City Weather Condition Icon
Step 5:
Final presentation
GitHub Usage Requirements ( Optional )
• Each team will have a GitHub repository and each team member
will be added as a collaborator.
• All tasks should be created as an issue on the issues page.
• Each team member will get assigned issues.
• Master will be protected. Branches and pull requests will be used
for development.
